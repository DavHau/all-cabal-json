    "description": "In the context of the <https://deepspec.org/main DeepSpec project>, parts of the\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers containers> library were\nformally verified using <https://github.com/antalsz/hs-to-coq hs-to-coq> and\nthe interactive theorem prover Coq.\n\nThis package depends on precisely the verified version of containers and\nre-exports the verified parts of the API, with module name and function name\nunchanged.\n\nIf you happen to use only the verified subset of the API, then you can simply change\n@containers@ to @containers-verified@ in your @.cabal@ file and earn bragging\nrights about using verified data structures in your project. Because the\ntypes from @containers@ are re-exported, you can still interface with other\nlibraries that depend on @containers@ directly.\n\nIf you happen to need additional modules or functions, you will have to\ndepend on both @containers@ and @containers-verified@, and use\n<https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#package-qualified-imports package-qualified imports> to disambiguate.\n\nThis package does not re-export any of the @….Internals@ modules.\n\nWe cannot control which type class instances are re-exported; these therefore\nmay give you access to unverified code. Also, the @containers@ code contains\nsome CPP directives; these can enable different code on your machine than the\ncode that we verified (e.g. different bit-widths).\n\nTo learn more about what exactly has been verified, and how wide the\nformalization gap is, see the paper\n<https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06960 “Ready, Set, Verify! Applying hs-to-coq to real-world Haskell code”>\nby Joachim Breitner, Antal Spector-Zabusky, Yao Li,\nChristine Rizkallah, John Wiegley and Stephanie Weirich.\n\nThe long-term maintenance plan for this package is not fleshed out yet, and\ncertainly depends on user-demand. Let us know your needs! (And your\ntechnical or financial abilities to contribute...)",
