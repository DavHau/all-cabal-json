    "description": "\nWumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript.\n\nWumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures,\nits salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies.\nIt can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The\ngenerated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably\nefficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and\n@grestore@, is minimized.\n\nPictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/.\nPaths themselves are made from points. The usual affine\ntransformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be\napplied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there is no\nnotion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a\ncoordinate-free style.\n\nGENERAL DRAWBACKS...\n\nFor actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very\nlow level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@\navailable that helps create certain types of diagram, but even\nthis lacks the higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.) that\nwould make creating general drawings easy.\n\nSome of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not\nsophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled,\nand how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so\nWumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However,\nthe design permits a fairly simple implementation - which is\na priority. Text encoding an exception - I\\'m not sure how\nreasonable the design is. The current implementation\nappears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other\ncharacter sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.\n\nWARNING...\n\nThe module @Core.BoundingBox@ is likely to be reworked\nsignificantly in the future. It has too many functions that do\nnot offer distinct functionality. Some functions were removed in\nrevision 0.17.0 and some more are likely to follow.\n\nThe module @Extra.PictureLanguage@ is deprecated. At some point\nit will be superceded by @wumpus-basic@ but this will not be soon.\n\n\n\\[1\\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript\ncode, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool\nto convert Wumpus'\\s EPS files to many other formats\n(bitmaps).\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.21.0 to 0.22.0:\n\n* Moved the deprecated module @Wumpus.Extra.PictureLanguage@\ninto the package Wumpus-Basic along with the example\n@Picture.hs@.\n\n* Added vec as a synonym for the constructor V2.\n\n* Changed some of the Core.FontSize to use better terminology.\nThus some of the constants have changed. Added a new example\n@FontMetrics.hs@ to illustrate how FontSize works.\nParticularly, the function @capHeight@ has been replaced with\nthe function @numeralHeight@ which has better semantics.\n\n* The CTM data type and ToCTM class are now hidden in the\ntop-level import module @Wumpus.Core@. They can be accessed\nby importing @Wumpus.Core.GraphicsState@ directly.\n\n* Exposed the PSUnit type class.\n\n0.20.0 to 0.21.0:\n\n* Removed the Primitive instances of the Affine transformation\nclasses. They have been replaced with special transformation\nfunctions: @rotatePrimitive@, @scalePrimitive@,\n@translatePrimitive@. As Primitives are not in an affine\nframe until they are lifted to Pictures the affine instances\nhad ill-conceived semantics.\n\n* Due to changes to accommodate the new non-affine\ntransformations, many of the class obligations have changed\non the @unit@ of Pictures, Primitives, Bounding Boxes etc.\nGenerally many class contexts that previously required\nFractional and Ord on the unit have changed to Real and\nFloating.\n\n* Removed demo/AffineTest04.hs - there is no longer a\n@rotateAbout@ operation on Primitives as they do not exist\nin an affine frame until they they are lifted to Pictures.\nAdded - Scaled.hs, Rotated.hs, Translated,hs.\n\n* Removed the UndecidableInstances pragma from\nCore.PictureInternal. It looks like Core.Geometry will always\nneed UndecidableInstances though.\n\n* Removed the Ord superclass constriant from the @Stroke@ and\n@Fill@ classes and derived operations (e.g. @zostroke@).\n\n",
